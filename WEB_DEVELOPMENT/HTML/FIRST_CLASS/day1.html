        <big><i>ABOUT HIS EARLY LIFE</i></big>
        <br><br>
        Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His mother Saroj Kohli is as a housewife
        while his father Prem Nath Kohli worked as a criminal lawyer. He has an elder brother Vikas and an elder sister
        Bhawna.[13] His formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. His early education was at Vishal Bharti Public
        School.[14] As per his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a 3-year-old. He would pick up a
        bat and request his father bowl to him.[15]

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created. In May, his father arranged for him to meet Rajkumar
        Sharma.[16] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a
        professional cricket academy, as they believed his ability merited more than gully cricket.[17] He was unable to
        secure a place in the U-14 Delhi team, due to extraneous factors. His father reportedly received offers to
        relocate his son to influential clubs, which would ensure his selection, but he declined the proposals.

        career, he transferred to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[17]

        On 18 December 2006, his father died due to a cerebral attack.[17][14] As per his mother, Kohli's demeanour
        shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took on cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing
        time and dedicating himself fully to the sport.[17] Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until
        the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.[19]
