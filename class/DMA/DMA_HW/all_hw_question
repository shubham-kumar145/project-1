Question 1 : Basic Resizing
Question: Dynamically allocate memory for an array of size 3 using malloc. Assign values 10, 20, 30. Then resize the array to size 5 using realloc and initialize the new elements with 40 and 50.

Input:
Original size: 3
New size: 5
Output:
Original array: 10 20 30
Resized array: 10 20 30 40 50

Question 2 : Shrinking an Array
Question: Allocate memory for an array of size 8 using calloc, initialize it with values 1 to 8, and shrink it to size 5 using realloc.

Input:
Initial size: 8
Shrink size: 5
Output:
Original array: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Resized array: 1 2 3 4 5

Question 3: Doubling Array Size
Question: Create an array of size n=4 using malloc and initialize it with values 1, 2, 3, 4. Double the size using realloc and initialize the new elements as 5, 6, 7, 8.

Input:
Initial size: 4
New size: 8
 Output:
Original array: 1 2 3 4
Resized array: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Question 4: Growing and Shrinking Dynamically
Question: Create an array of size n=3 using calloc. Resize it to n=6 using realloc (initialize new elements as 10, 20, 30) and then shrink it back to n=4.

Input:
Initial size: 3
Resize to: 6
Shrink to: 4
Output:
Original array: 0 0 0
After growing: 0 0 0 10 20 30
After shrinking: 0 0 0 10
